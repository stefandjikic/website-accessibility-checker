## Website Accessibility Checker

An express app serving a static HTML page that checks provided URL of a website and returns accessibility issues pointing to the piece of code that needs to be addressed. 

### How it works

It uses the `pa11y` package with `node js` and `express` to create a simple API that we can hit from the frontend of the app to get the results.


On the frontend, it uses plain JavaScript and HTML to connect with the API and display the results.
